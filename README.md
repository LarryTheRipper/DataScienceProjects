Airbnb, Inc. is a San Francisco-based American company that operates an online platform for short-term accommodations and experiences. They offer listings in more than 220 countries and regions worldwide. Like many other industries, Airbnb was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

This project aims to analyze the pandemic's impact on Airbnb's property listings, focusing on data from Singapore over a four-year period (2018-2022). The primary tools used for conducting analyses and creating visualizations in this project include Python 3.11 and its libraries, particularly Plotly and Pandas. 

## Points to Analyze

The main points that are analyzed and focused on in this project are as follows:
- **Room type:** how the prices and ultimately the reviews (occupancy) varies by room type.
- **Location:** how each neighbourhood and by extension each region stacks up against one another in pricing and occupancy.
- **Trend:** how the occupancy trend looks like throughout the 4 years and the impact of the pandemic on occupancy rates
